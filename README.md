# Basic-Python-Projects

Here, I have done 2 basic python project - 
1. "Word Counter from Text"
2. "Line Counter from Text".

# 1. Word Counter from Text
This code takes a file path as input, opens the specified text file, counts the number of words in the file's content, and then prints the word count to the console. It includes error handling to deal with cases where the specified file doesn't exist.

# 2. Line Counter from Text
This code reads the content of a file specified by the user, splits the content into words, counts the total number of lines and elements, and prints out these counts.
